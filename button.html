          <p>First  generation(1940-1956)
            The first generation of computers used vacuum tubes as a major piece of technology. Vacuum tubes were widely used in computers from 1940 through 1956. Vacuum tubes were larger components and resulted in first-generation computers being quite large in size, taking up a lot of space in a room. Some first-generation computers took up an entire room.
            The ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) is a great example of a first-generation computer. It consisted of nearly 20,000 vacuum tubes, 10,000 capacitors, and 70,000 resistors. It weighed over 30 tons and took up a lot of space, requiring a large room to house it. Other examples of first-generation computers include the EDSAC (Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator), IBM 701, and Manchester Mark 1.
